This is the code for the article "Blind Image Quality Assessment Based on Multichannel Features Fusion and 
Label Transfer" by Qingbo Wu; Hongliang Li; Fanman Meng; King N. Ngan; Bing Zeng; Bing Luo; Chao Huang 

We aim to predict a query image's perceptual quality without any prior information of its undistorted refe-
rence image and the distortion type presented in it. 

This is a vanilla version, so if you find a bug, contact Qingbo Wu at
